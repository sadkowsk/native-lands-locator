## Uses

### Direct Uses
NatLlo supports educational and research activities in indigenous studies and geography. It enables content creators and researchers to include native/indigenous perspectives in their work, enhancing cultural awareness and supporting diversity.

### Out-of-Scope Uses
NatLlo is not designed for legal purposes, such as determining land ownership, resolving territorial disputes, and other land management decisions. It is also unsuitable for navigational services. It should not be used for commercial exploitation of native/indigenous cultures, influencing political boundaries, governmental policymaking, or personal identification or tracking within geographic regions.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations
- **Bias:** NatLlo may reflect biases from its training data, potentially leading to uneven representation or inaccuracies in identifying native/indigenous lands.
- **Risks:** Misuse or misinterpretation of NatLlo's outputs could result in misinformation or harm to indigenous communities.
- **Limitations:** NatLlo's recognition of geographic entities and indigenous territories might not be exhaustive or fully up-to-date.

### Recommendations
- **Cross-Verification:** Users should cross-verify NatLlo's outputs with authoritative sources for accuracy and up-to-date information.
- **Cultural Consultation:** Engage with indigenous experts or communities when interpreting information related to their lands and histories.
- **Ethical Usage:** Employ NatLlo responsibly, avoiding contexts where misinterpretation could lead to cultural insensitivity or misinformation.

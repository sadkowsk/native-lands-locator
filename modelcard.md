# Model Card for Native Lands Locator (NatLlo)

Native Lands Locator (NatLLo) is a custom GPT hosted by OpenAI that matches your inputs' geographic references with nearby native and indigenous lands.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Native Lands Locator (NatLLo) is a custom GPT hosted by OpenAI that matches your inputs' geographic references with nearby native and indigenous lands. After identifying geographic entities and relating them to nearby native lands, it then explores the cultural and historical connections of the two. NatLlo has implications for further development using other models and approaches.

## Uses

### Direct Uses

NatLlo identifies geographic entities in texts and maps them to native/indigenous lands, aiding educational and research activities in indigenous studies and geography. It enables content creators and researchers to include native/indigenous perspectives in their work, enhancing cultural awareness and supporting diversity. Additionally, it assists in developing educational materials for a comprehensive understanding of history.

### Out-of-Scope Uses

NatLlo is not designed for legal purposes, such as determining land ownership, resolving territorial disputes, and other land management decisions. It is also unsuitable for navigational services. It should not be used for commercial exploitation of native/indigenous cultures, influencing political boundaries, or governmental policy-making, nor for personal identification or tracking within geographic regions.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

- **Bias:** The model may reflect biases from its training data, potentially leading to uneven representation or inaccuracies in identifying native/indigenous lands.
- **Risks:** Misuse or misinterpretation of the model's outputs could result in misinformation or harm to indigenous communities.
- **Limitations:** The model's recognition of geographic entities and indigenous territories might not be exhaustive or fully up-to-date, and it is not intended for legal or real-time decision-making purposes.

### Recommendations

- **Cross-Verification:** Users should cross-verify model outputs with authoritative sources for accuracy and up-to-date information.
- **Cultural Consultation:** Engage with indigenous experts or communities when interpreting data related to their lands and histories.
- **Ethical Usage:** Employ the model responsibly, avoiding contexts where misinterpretation could lead to cultural insensitivity or misinformation.
- **Continuous Learning:** Update the model regularly with diverse and inclusive datasets to reduce biases and improve representation.
